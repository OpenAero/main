			<p>OpenAero is aerobatic sequence design software available from
			<a href="https://openaero.net/" target="_blank">OpenAero.net</a> that
	    runs inside your web browser. This makes it available on practically
	    any computer, tablet and even smartphone. For the best experience the
			<a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/browser/" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a> 
			web browser is recommended, but most browsers published from 2016
			onward should function correctly. It is useful to set 
			the full-screen browser mode (usually by pressing F11 on your keyboard) 
			to have the maximum screen space available when using OpenAero.</p>
			<p>The latest version of the software is always presented when you are 
			online, and will be installed automatically. Once you have visted
			<a href="https://openaero.net/" target="_blank">openaero.net</a> your
	    current version of the software will also be available to you when
	    you are offline. For small tablets and smartphones it will help to
	    select <i>Phone layout</i> in <i>Settings</i> so the layout will be adjusted
	    to fit the narrower screen format.</p>
	    <p>OpenAero should update automatically to the latest version
	    whenever you are online and open OpenAero. However, if you suspect
	    you do not have the latest version you can check this through
	    <i>About</i> in the <i>Help</i> menu. If this shows you have an
	    outdated version and you are using openaero.net on Google Chrome
	    (but not as an app) it may help to clear the appCache. Enter
	    <strong>chrome://appcache-internals</strong> in your address bar
	    and <strong>Remove</strong> all entries that contain OpenAero.</p>
	    <h3>iOS, Android and Windows 10 app</h3>
	    <p>An app is available for most common platforms. Beside normal
	    OpenAero functionality this offers:
	    <ul>
				<li>improved handling of .seq sequence files</li>
				<li>guaranteed offline performance</li>
				<li>supporting OpenAero development with your financial contribution</li>
	    </ul>

		<p>Even though no other software besides OpenAero is necessary to 
		produce complete and valid aerobatic sequences, the ready availability 
		of an official and current copy of the relevant power or glider
		<a href="http://www.arestisystem.com/" target="_blank">Aresti catalog</a>
    is recommended for checking.</p>
    <p>This manual is intended for users of OpenAero. If you are interested in 
    development of additions to OpenAero, including (national) rules, please

		<h3 id="creating_sequences">Creating sequences</h3>
		<p>Aerobatic sequences can be created within OpenAero in one of three 
		ways:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>By starting and using the Free (Un)Known Designer (not available in phone layout)</li>
			<li>By selecting and editing figures with the <i>Figure Editor</i></li>
			<li>By writing the figures in code in the text line above the 
			sequence</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The descriptions here refer to using the 
		<i>Figure Editor</i>. For the 
		correct codes when using the text line above the sequence area please 
		refer to <a href="language.html" target="_blank">OpenAero language <i>Help</i></a>.</p>
		</span>
	</div>
	<div class="documentation">
		<span>
      <h3>Beginning a sequence</h3>
      <img src="../img/sequence_info.png">
      <p>
				When opening a Free Known or Unknown figures file you will be
				asked if you want to start the Free (Un)Known Designer. If you
				do, you will fill out the Sequence Info panel later.<br />
				Please refer to chapter <a href="#free_unknown_designer">
				The Free (Un)Known Designer</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
        In all other cases, always start by filling in the Sequence
        Info panel. The <i>Rules, Category</i> and <i>Program</i>
        information will be used for determining sequence 
        validity. If actual rule checking is active for the chosen
        combination, <i class="material-icons status good"></i> will be
        shown at the top of the Rules card. Otherwise it will show
        <i class="material-icons status bad"></i>.
        In the latter case sequences are only checked for basic Aresti
        compliance.
      </p>
      <h4 id="contest_information">Contest information</h4>
      <p>
	  The contest information box can be used to enter location, date,
      logo and notes for the contest.
      </p>
      <p>It is possible to copy, paste or lock this information. When
      locked it can not be changed, not even by opening another 
      sequence.
      </p>
      <p>You can choose one of the
      predefined logos or add your own. A maximum of 3 logos can be
      added. If you want to add another, delete one of the older ones.
      </p>
      <h4>Sequence entry direction</h4>
      <p>In the Sequence menu you can choose to start the sequence 
      down-wind or cross-box. This can always be changed at a later stage.</p>
		</span>
	</div>
	<div class="documentation">

		<h3 id="adding_a_figure">Adding a figure</h3>
		<p><img src="../img/OA_FigureAddPanel.png">
		Go to the <i>Figure editor</i> tab and click on the <i>Add figure</i> box.
    A figure chooser will appear from which you can choose a group (for 
		example 1.2 Two Lines) and then a specific base figure. The Aresti
    number column and row are indicated at the top and left side of the
    figure chooser.<br>
    At any point
    in a figure where the attitude must change from erect to inverted
    (or the reverse) a half-roll is shown and will be incorporated when
    the figure is inserted; this is easily changed for an alternate roll
    using the controls. If there are existing figures select the option 
		to tell OpenAero where the new figure should be placed. Figures that are eligible 
		to be placed in the current position (i.e. with the correct entry and/or exit 
		attitude) are marked by a green line around the top and left sides of 
		their images.</p>
    <p><img src="../img/OA_FigureSelection.png" style="float:left;">
    When there are Sequence rules active that prohibit the use of
    certain base figures, those figures will not be shown. It is
    possible to show these figures (with a red border) by unselecting
    <i>Hide illegal figs</i>.</p>
		<p>
		When a figure is added or selected it becomes active and is drawn in 
		magenta in the sequence area. The Aresti/K table is always updated to display 
		all the Aresti element codes and K-factors. Base figures and elements that are 
		not &#39;legal&#39; according to the rules in effect are shown in that table 
		with zero K.</p>
		<div class="clearBoth"></div>
		<img src="../img/OA_FigureInfoPanel.png">
		<p>The current figure is also shown in the figure editing area where you can:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Set the figure as start of a sub-sequence</li>
			<li>Change the Y-axis direction</li>
			<li>Delete the figure</li>
			<li>Switch X-axis or Y-axis in-figure and exit direction (for some figures)</li>
			<li>Zoom the figure smaller or larger</li>
			<li>Move the figure to a different position - with no line, or with 
			a straight or curved dotted connecting line</li>
			<li>Extend or shorten the entry and exit lines, or the lengths
      before and after the rolls</li>
			<li>Click the figure-start and -end symbols to reverse the current 
			erect / inverted setting</li>
			<li>For Free Unknown sequences designate the figure with letters A 
			to J, or as a Additional figure</li>
			<li>Add / delete / change rolls, and:
        <ul>
          <li>Flip their left / right orientation to avoid location over
          other elements</li>
          <li>Flip the roll fraction number (e.g. 3/4)</li>
          <li>Add a comment (will be placed after fraction number where
          applicable)</li>
        </ul>
        When sequence rules are active, only rolls that are allowed will
        be shown. Nevertheless, some combinations may not be allowed. If
        these are used an alert will then be shown in the Alerts section.
      </li>
      <li>Add / delete / change figure comments</li>
		</ul>
    <p><strong>Some of these options are not available for figures that
    have a Free Unknown letter to avoid changing Free Unknown figures.
    </strong></p>
    <img src="../img/blue_handles.png" style="float:left;">
    <p>Another way to edit the figure shape is to use the handles (blue
    circles) that show when selecting the figure. These allow you to
    change the length of all lines. In the top-right of the figure a
    magnifier shows which can be used to scale the entire figure.<br />
    It is possible to disable this way of figure editing through
    <i>Settings</i>.</p>
		<p>When you have finished editing the figure click in an adjacent space 
		to deactivate it, then you can add a new figure at the end of the 
		sequence or optionally at the beginning. If a figure is highlighted when 
		you click to add a figure then it will be opened again for editing.</p>
		</span>
	</div>
	<div class="documentation">
    <span>
      <h3 id="figure_comments">Figure comments</h3>
      <p>The comment section can be used to enter information about the 
      figure. Plain text can be used but there is also a variety of
      useful special codes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>[</strong> : bold-line the comment box on Form B, C, R &amp; L
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>[[</strong> : red-line the comment box on Form B, C, R &amp; L
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>\</strong> : new line
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>^</strong> : rotate the comment box 90 degrees, e.g. for "^BREAK"
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>NED</strong> : use three letter 
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IOC_country_codes#Current_NOCs" target="_blank">
          IOC country code</a> in capitals to add the country's flag 
          to Grid view

      <h3>Automated handling of Free and Compulsory&nbsp;/&nbsp;Free&nbsp;Unknown
      sequence figures</h3>
      <p>When on the Sequence Info panel a combination of Class : Rules : Category : Program 
      is set that requires special handling to meet CIVA regulations, 
      the software will provide the following automated handling:</p>
      <p><strong>Glider Advanced and Unlimited</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Free sequences: OpenAero will resolve an excess sequence K 
          total of up to 3 in accordance with 4.3.3.1.b). The original 
          figure-K is shown in brackets below the adjusted value.</li>
          <li>Unknown Compulsory sequences: OpenAero will reset up to 2 
          figures that you designate as 'Free Unknown Link' to 10K total.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p><strong>Power and Glider Advanced and Unlimited</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Free Unknown sequences: you should identify each submitted 
          figure with the officially designated alpha character (power 
          'A' to 'J', glider 'A' to G'). Linking figures should be 
          identified as 'Free Unknown Link', and OpenAero will reset 
          them to 24K total (power) or 10K total (glider).</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </span>
  </div>
	<div id="selecting_moving" class="documentation">
		<span>
      <h3>Selecting and moving a figure</h3>
      <p>To select a figure, click on it or select it in the sequence
      text line. The figure is now magenta and can be edited with the 
      figure editor. For repositioning it can be dragged anywhere by holding 
      down the mouse button after clicking the figure. Note: this can
      not be done for figure 1.</p>
      <p>After moving a figure it's possible to change the curved line 
      to a straight line by clicking the <i>Straight line</i> button in
      the Figure editor. It's also possible to remove the line, but for
      clarity only for horizontal moves. This can be done by clicking the
      <i>Move figure forward</i> button.</p>
      <p><i>TIP</i> : A poorly laid-out sequence that is difficult to 
      follow can be a real problem for judges - time spent creating an 
      easily understood flow of figures can be a good way to help improve 
      your marks. Make sure to use the straight and curved dotted lines to 
      show how your figures follow each other.</p>
		</span>
	</div>
	<div class="documentation">
		<span>
		<h3>Using the OpenAero &#39;Queue&#39;</h3>
		<p>The queue system provides a way to copy selected figures to a 
		temporary list, from which they may conveniently be selected for 
		insertion at other positions in the sequence. This enables the figures 
		in any sequence to be re-ordered to improve the sequence design, though 
		you must take care of erect or inverted entry conditions and continue / 
		reverse / change axis effects. The queue and its figures can also be 
		saved to disk for later re-use - when re-opened they are accessible 
		through the &quot;* Figure Queue&quot; item at the top of the figure / family 
		selection drop-list.</p>
    <p>The background of queue figures will be green when the figure is
    already present in the sequence. It will be red if the figure is
    used multiple times.</p>
    <p>All figures in a sequence can be added to the queue at once by 
    clicking <i>Add all to queue</i>. All figures can be removed from
    the queue with <i>Clear queue</i>.</p>
		</span>
		<span>
    </span>
	</div>
	<div class="documentation">
		<span>
      <h3>Keeping the figures separate</h3>
      <p>When figures are overlapping they can be dragged to a new position. 
      It is also possible to use <i>Separate figures</i> from the <i>Sequence menu</i> to 
      separate all figures from each other.</p>
       <p>OpenAero can position new and updated figures clear
      of previous and subsequent figures automatically. To activate
      this, go to <i>General Settings</i> and select the option
      <i>Automatically position new/changed figures clear of others</i>.
      </p>
      <p>To remove all current sequence formatting choose 
      <i>Clear positioning</i> from the <i>Sequence menu</i>.</p>
		</span>
	</div>
	<div class="documentation">
		<span>
		<h3>Checking sequences against the selected Rules</h3>
		<p>Choose <i>Sequence ... Check sequence</i> and your sequence will be checked 
		against the rules that you have selected in the <i>Sequence Info</i> setup. 
		Note that any construction errors are shown in the <i>Alerts</i> box below the 
		figure editor. If you print the sequence you can opt to add the <i>Sequence 
		Check Result</i> to the bottom of your Form B, C, R or L.</p>
		<p class="noCordova">Several sequences can be checked simultaneously by choosing and/or dragging 
		their files to the box shown when you click menu item <i>Tools ... Check 
		multiple seq</i>.</p>
    <p>When creating a Free Unknown sequence, it is possible to use the
    original submitted figures to check if they are correct in your
    sequence. To do this, click <i>Reference sequence</i> in the
    <i>Sequence info</i> tab. A dialog will show where you can enter
    a sequence string for a reference sequence. This string can for
    example be copied from the main sequence text area when you have
    the original submitted figures opened in OpenAero.</p>
    <p>For the Free Known, the reference sequence will automatically be
    loaded when activating the Free Known rules.</p>
    <h3>Floating Point correction</h3>
    <p>In some sequence types, a Floating Point correction is
    allowed. This means that one or more K points may be deducted from
    the figures with the highest K factors if this is necessary to
    reduce total sequence K to the maximum allowed.</p>
    <p>The Floating Point correction is automatically applied when
    corresponding rules are set in the Sequence Info.</p>
		</span>
	</div>
  <div class="documentation">
    <span id="free_unknown_designer">
      <h2>The Free (Un)known designer</h2>
      This is an efficient way to design a Free Known or Unknown
      sequence from a list of submitted figures. It can be found under
      the <i>Tools</i> menu on desktop or the main menu on mobile.
      Because of required screen size it is not available in the phone layout.
      <h3>Getting started</h3>
      Open a sequence file containing the Free (Un)known figures from the
      <i>File</i> menu, or by clicking a link holding the sequence that
      has been provided to you. If the sequence is correctly formatted
      (correct rules, all figure letters assigned, no other figures)
      OpenAero should automatically start the Free (Un)known designer.<br />
      Otherwise, you can start it from the menu.<br />
      If OpenAero detects it is just a figures file you will start with
      an empty sequence. Otherwise, the current sequence will be shown.
      <p><img src="../img/OA_FreeUnknownDesignerMain.png" style="max-width: 95%"></img></p>
      <h3>Sequence layout</h3>
      <p>The purpose of the designer is to quickly create a sequence. For
      this reason, layout is schematic and fully automated. There are no
      options for changing this.<br />
      Multiple subsequences can be used, joined and copied in the design
      environment.<br />
      In the sequences, submitted figures are marked with a green border
      and Additional (for the Unknown) or Free (for the Known) figures
      with a blue border.</p>
      <ul>
			  <li>To put a Master figure into the sequence:
		      <ul>
					  <li>For the first figure - drag & drop it the onto the
			      "Drop Figure Here" box</li>
			      <li>For subsequent figures - drag & drop it where you want
			      to insert it</li>
				  </ul>
			  </li>
			  <li>To put a Free figure into the sequence:
			  <ul>
					<li>Drag & drop the orange "Free x/5" rectangle where you
				  want to insert it, then click the desired Free figure to put
				  it there.</li>
			  </ul>
			</ul>
      <p>When the sequence is complete, click the <i>Finalize sequence</i>
      button to use the normal editing system and change the layout of
      the sequence.</p>
      <h3>Adding and changing figures in a subsequence</h3>
      <p>All submitted Free (Un)known figures are visible on the lefthand
      <i>Figures</i> tab. They can be dragged and dropped into a
      subsequence and will be placed before the figure over which they
      are dropped. To create a new subsequence, drag the figure to
      <i>New / copy subsequence</i>.<br />
      Figures that are used exactly once in any of the subsequences are
      marked by a green border. Figures that are used multiple times (or
      more than the maximum amount of Additionals/Free for the Additional/Free
      figure) are marked orange.</p>
      <p>To remove a figure, click the cross in the righthand upper
      corner.</p>
      <p>Additional or Free figures can be added by dropping the
      'Additional' or 'Free'
      block. After this has been done the figure can be changed
      after selecting it by clicking.<br />
      The submitted figures also have some options that can be changed
      when selected.<br />
      </p>
      <h3>Manipulating subsequences</h3>
      The entry direction of each subsequence can be chosen by selecting
      the first figure of it and setting <i>Sub sequence entry
      direction</i>.<br />
      Subsequences can be dragged as a whole into another subsequence.
      The whole subsequence will then be inserted before the figure over
      which it is dragged. Dragging a subsequence to <i>New /copy
      subsequence</i> will create a copy of the subsequence.
      <h3>Finalizing the sequence</h3>
      <p>When the sequence is complete, with all submitted figures and
      required Additionals, it can be finalized by clicking <i>Finalize
      sequence</i>. Any errors will be
      reported. You will then be returned to the regular sequence editor
      where you can adjust layout.</p>

		<span id="opening_saving">
      <h3>Opening, Saving and Printing sequences</h3>
      <h4>Opening sequences</h4>
      <p>To open an existing sequence, choose <i>Open sequence</i> in
      the <i>File menu</i> and navigate to locate and open the required
      sequence file. Sequence files can end in &quot;.seq&quot; or
      &quot;.png&quot;. <span class="noCordova">You can also drag a
      sequence file from your system's file browser to the OpenAero
      window to open it.</span><br />
      Alternatively, by using <i>Open sequence link</i>, you can open a
      sequence link provided to you by email or other means.
      </p>
      <h4>Saving sequences</h4>
      <p class="noCordova">To save the current sequence as a
      <i>&quot;filename.seq&quot;</i>
      file, choose <i>Save sequence</i> in the <i>File menu</i>.
      <span class="noUWP">
		  Depending
      on how you have set your browser, your computer will ask

      <h3 id="grid_system">The Figure Grid system for Unknown and Free&nbsp;Unknown operations
      </h3>
      <p>
        <img src="../img/OA_FigureGrid.gif" style="max-width: 95%">
        Either from the very start or from an existing sequence, <i>View ... 
        Figs in Grid</i> will set each figure into a tabular grid format showing the 
        K-factors and any other relevant information.
        This grid can be printed for distribution to sequence designers
        bearing all the relevant figure information, so that submitted
        sequences conform to CIVA regulations.
      </p>
      <p>
				<img src="../img/OA_GridInfo.png" style="float:left;">
        The Grid View contains an info box that assists in selection of
        Free Unknown figures. The box can be dragged to almost any
        location to prevent overlapping other elements.<br />
        Use the <i>Grid info</i> to 
        change the number of grid columns or ordering of figures if
        required (accessible through Settings on small mobile layout).<br />
        The box provides information on the amount of
        positive and negative figure entries and exits, as well as the
        associated Low, Neutral or High speed.<br />
        Below this is an indication of the needed number of Additionals
        to create a full sequence. This is estimated by matching the
        figures based on attitude and speed
        <span class="docsExtraInfo">(tap here for full explanation).
          <span>
            </br>To determine matching every base figure is assigned Low,
            Neutral or High speed for entry and exit. This is simply
            determined by any form of climb or descent at the start and
            end of the figure.</br>
            For example, a 45 climbing line has High speed entry and Low
            speed exit. A downgoing loop has Low speed entry and Low
            speed exit. A rolling turn has Neutral entry and exit. Etc...
            Note that this is completely independent from any rolls or
            further continuation in the figure. It thus presents a
            simplified but useable categorization.</br>
            To determine which figures match, the algorithm proceeds as
            follows:</br>
            1) For the entire procedure, only match correct upright or
              inverted attitude</br>
            2) Try to match the first figure with all following figures,
              only using exact matches: High speed exit with High speed
              entry, etc...</br>
            3) Do 2) for all following figures that have not yet been
              matched to others</br>
            4) Start again from 2, but this time also accept matching
              Neutral speed with High speed or Low speed</br>
            5) Do an extra run just as the previous, but with all the
              figures in reverse order</br>
            6) The lowest number of sets resulting from 4) and 5) is
              used to determine how many additionals are needed. E.g. 3
              sets means 2 additionals are needed</br>
          </span>
        </span>
        </br>
        This is only an indication! The real number needed will
        also depend on sequence design preferences, box constraints and
        aircraft performance characteristics.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the grid info panel there is also a button to create groups.
        In the resulting dialog you can automatically generate semi-random
        matching figure group proposals. This can be used for selection
        of matching figure groups out of a large number of figures.</br>
        When the combination is not acceptable, click <i>Create new
        proposals</i> for a new combination.</br> 
        When a satisfactory combination has been generated these can be
        copy-pasted to another instance of OpenAero or all loaded
        directly into the Grid.
      </p>
      <p>
        It may be useful to add the submitting Team name or IOC country code 
        to the figure comments. This can be done in the Figure Editor or
        by typing it between inverted marks into the sequence string
        after any Free Unknown identification letter
        &quot;@A&quot;, &quot;@B&quot; etc. and before the figure code - 
        for example &quot;@F USA&quot;. This will be shown in the grid 
        adjacent to the figure designation if present, 
        or the first Aresti manoeuvre code if not.<br>
        Also, the country flag will be added to the Grid view 
        (courtesy of <a href="http://www.icondrawer.com" target="_blank">www.icondrawer.com</a>).

      <h3>Importing OpenAero files into ACRO</h3>
      <p>
        OpenAero files that are stored in <i>&quot;filename.seq&quot;</i> format can be

        and accurate method for transferring all of the required figure 
        information. Note that the OpenAero figure text string does not 
        provide the necessary data for this procedure, and should generally be
